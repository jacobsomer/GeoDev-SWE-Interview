# GeoDev SWE Interview

## Why an assignment for our interview?

The GeoDev team wishes to give every aspiring team member a fair chance to show off their skills. Traditionally, coding interviews test how hard students study, but they fail to test how good someone is at the actual job. This assignment walks students through a full-stack codebase where students are given the opportunity learn, have fun, and accomplish a real GeoLab task.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic understanding of Python (i.e. intro to cs, intro to data science, or self-taught)
2. A recent version of [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine
3. An installation of `Python 3.7 or newer`.
    - [download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-macos11.pkg) for macOS
    - [download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe) for Windows.
4. An installation of git (Windows Only).
    - [Download](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.35.1.windows.2/Git-2.35.1.2-64-bit.exe) for Windows.
5. A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Optional)

When you have completed these steps, try running the following commands in a terminal (or Command Prompt if Windows):

```
npm --version
